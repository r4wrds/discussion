# Discussion

# How This Repository Works
Public discussion will be held in [the issues][] of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new issue. Tag your peers using their handle—`@ryanpeek`, for example—to get their attention.

[the issues]: https://github.com/r4wrds/discussion/issues

Lots of the good stuff will end up in [closed issues](https://github.com/gge-ucd/Discussion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), so don't forget to look there! Or, more generally, use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.

Please don't be shy, don't let the term "issue" deter you from asking questions or posting things others might find useful. If you have a question, someone else probably does too...ideally this will be a repository of tips and solutions that we can all refer back to in the future.
